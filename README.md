# Directus railway template

This example runs a [Directus](https://directus.io/) instance with minimal config using PostgreSQL.

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app/template/ZOQXZf?referralCode=nnevrP)

## ✨ Predefined Features

- Directus
- PostgreSQL
- Redis
- S3

## 💁‍♀️ How to use

- Add the .env vars on template (you can add more vars when the app is deployed).
- Let railway deploy your service, grab the generated domain from the service settings.
- Login in the panel using the defined ADMIN_EMAIL and ADMIN_PASSWORD used in .env vars

## 📝 Notes

- This is a minimal one-click-deploy solution to Directus, see [Directus docs](https://docs.directus.io/getting-started/introduction.html) to config it to your needs.

- Re-deploys won't erase your db data. Only re-dploy by updating the copied repo.
